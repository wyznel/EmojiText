# Emoji Text
> A [CT](https://chattriggers.com/) module


## Prerequisites
To use this module, the following requirements **must** be met:
1) [ChatTriggers](https://chattriggers.com/), version 3.0.0
2) [IsTyping](https://github.com/wyznel/IsTyping/) is required for this module to work (it's a ct library written by me)

## Description
**EmojiText** has ***all*** the emoticons you may need in one place!

Get started by importing the module then running **``/emojitext help``**.

By default this module is enabled, to test try typing 'tick' (including the single quotes!) in chat.

Limited number of emoticons at the moment, more ***will*** be added i swear

At the moment, this module is not available to be imported from the official ChatTriggers website, I am waiting for release verification.

Here is the module page on CT: [Module Page](https://chattriggers.com/modules/v/EmojiText)
