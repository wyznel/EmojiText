**EmojiText** has ***all*** the emoticons you may need in one place!

Get started by importing the module then running **``/emojitext help``**.

By default this module is enabled, to test try typing 'tick' (including the single quotes!) in chat.

Limited number of emoticons at the moment, more ***will*** be added i swear
